# Frontend

This is Angular 11 front-end application for [Cloud ERP School Management Server](https://github.com/cloud-erp-school-system/backend) 

## Prerequisites
You will need the following tools to set up your local development environment:
- [Node.js & NPM LTS](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- [Angular CLI 11.0.2](https://cli.angular.io/) (run `npm install -g @angular/cli`)

## Setting up
Clone repository, move to directory, open terminal and type `npm install`

## Development server
To start a development server, run `ng serve` (or  `npm run start` if you don't have Angular CLI installed globally).
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Using Angular Materials
All angular material components and corresponding APIs can be found in the [documentation](https://material.angular.io/components/categories).
Before using each component you would need to import corresponding module from `@angular/material/{name of module}`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
