This is Angular 11 front-end application for [Cloud ERP School Management Server](https://github.com/cloud-erp-school-system/backend) 

## Prerequisites
You would need following tools to set up local development environment:
- [Angular CLI 11.0.2](https://cli.angular.io/)
- [Node.js & NPM LTS](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

## Setting up
Clone repository, move to directory, open terminal and type `npm install`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
